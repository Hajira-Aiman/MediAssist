## 🚨 Feature 1 — Emergency Rule Engine (Pre-ML Triage)

> **What to demonstrate:** The system intercepts **life-threatening inputs BEFORE the ML model runs** and immediately escalates to a critical alert, bypassing any probabilistic scoring.

### TC-E01 — Stroke Symptoms 🔴
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I suddenly have slurred speech and one-sided facial weakness"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | 🚨 Critical Alert triggered. Escalation message displayed immediately. No disease prediction shown. |
| **Detected Category** | `Neurological Emergency` |
| **Triggered Keywords** | `slurred speech`, `facial weakness` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The ML model is completely bypassed. The rule engine fires before TF-IDF vectorization. |

---

### TC-E02 — Respiratory Emergency 🔴
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I am coughing up blood and can't breathe properly"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | 🚨 Critical Alert. No probability scores returned. |
| **Detected Category** | `Respiratory Emergency` |
| **Triggered Keywords** | `coughing up blood`, `can't breathe` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Even if the ML might predict "Asthma" (due to feature overlap), the rule engine intervenes first — showing the value of deterministic safety over probabilistic inference. |

---

### TC-E03 — Cardiac Emergency 🔴
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have crushing chest pain and the pain is radiating to my left arm"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | 🚨 Critical Alert. Immediate escalation. |
| **Detected Category** | `Cardiac Emergency` |
| **Triggered Keywords** | `crushing chest pain`, `pain radiating to arm` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Heart attack patterns are hardcoded as non-negotiable safety rules, independent of training data biases. |

---

### TC-E04 — Severe Infection (Meningitis Pattern) 🔴
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a very high fever with stiff neck and extreme confusion"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | 🚨 Critical Alert. Multiple categories may fire simultaneously. |
| **Detected Categories** | `Severe Infection` |
| **Triggered Keywords** | `stiff neck`, `extreme confusion`, `very high fever` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The engine detects **multiple emergency signals** in a single input and reports all. |

---

### TC-E05 — Hemorrhagic Warning 🔴
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have been having bleeding gums and blood in my vomit since morning"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | 🚨 Critical Alert. Hemorrhagic pattern detected. |
| **Detected Category** | `Hemorrhagic Warning` |
| **Triggered Keywords** | `bleeding gums`, `blood in vomit` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Dengue hemorrhagic fever and internal bleeding are patterns that ML models often mislabel. The rule engine catches them at zero cost. |

---

### TC-E06 — No Emergency (Baseline) ✅
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a mild headache and a runny nose since yesterday"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | No alert triggered. System proceeds normally to ML pipeline. |
| **Detected Category** | None |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Demonstrates **precision** — the engine does NOT over-trigger. Only genuine emergencies are escalated. |

---

## 🔮 Feature 2 — Uncertainty-Aware ML Predictions

> **What to demonstrate:** For non-emergency inputs, the ML pipeline returns **Top-3 predictions with probability scores, entropy, and Top-2 gap** instead of a single confident (and potentially wrong) guess.

### TC-U01 — Clear, High-Confidence Prediction ✅
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a runny nose, mild cough, sneezing, and slight sore throat"` |
| **Expected Top Prediction** | `Common Cold` (~75–85% confidence) |
| **Expected Uncertainty** | Low entropy, high Top-2 gap (model is confident) |
| **flag_unreliable** | `False` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | System identifies a clean symptom profile. Low entropy means prediction is reliable. |

---

### TC-U02 — Ambiguous Input Triggering High Uncertainty ⚠️
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I feel tired and have some mild pain"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | Top-3 predictions shown with closely spaced probabilities. Follow-up questions triggered. |
| **Expected Uncertainty** | High entropy (> 0.7), small Top-2 gap (< 0.2) |
| **flag_unreliable** | `True` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Vague symptoms create high uncertainty. Instead of confidently guessing wrong, the system flags the prediction as unreliable and asks follow-up questions. |

---

### TC-U03 — Multi-Symptom Respiratory Case
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have been coughing with yellow mucus, chest tightness, and mild fever for three days"` |
| **Expected Top Predictions** | `Pneumonia`, `Bronchitis`, `Flu` |
| **Expected Uncertainty** | Moderate entropy; follow-up questions may be triggered |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Several respiratory diseases share overlapping features. The **Top-K approach** honestly shows all plausible diagnoses rather than masking uncertainty with false confidence. |

---

### TC-U04 — Digestive Symptoms
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have been vomiting and have diarrhea and severe stomach cramps"` |
| **Expected Top Predictions** | `Gastroenteritis`, `Food Poisoning`, `Irritable Bowel Syndrome` |
| **Expected Uncertainty** | Moderate. Predictions should be within the gastrointestinal category. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The TF-IDF vectorizer picks up domain-specific gastro terms and clusters them correctly. |

---

### TC-U05 — Skin Condition
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a red itchy rash with small blisters on my arm and it keeps spreading"` |
| **Expected Top Predictions** | `Contact Dermatitis`, `Chickenpox`, `Impetigo` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Demonstrates the system's breadth across non-respiratory disease domains. |

---

## 🔍 Feature 3 — Medical Consistency Validation & Reranking

> **What to demonstrate:** After ML prediction, a post-processing safety layer **penalizes predictions that are biologically implausible** given the symptoms described. This corrects for training data biases.

### TC-C01 — Implausible Prediction Suppression 🎯
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have high fever and a persistent cough"` |
| **Initial ML Predictions (simulated)** | `Common Cold (0.80)`, `Conjunctivitis (0.70)` |
| **After Consistency Check** | `Common Cold (0.80)` stays. `Conjunctivitis` penalized to `0.07` (0.70 × 0.1 penalty) |
| **Detected Symptom Categories** | `fever`, `respiratory` |
| **Conjunctivitis Disease Categories** | `eye` — no overlap |
| **Consistency Score** | `LOW → Penalty Applied` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | An eye infection predicted for fever + cough is biologically incoherent. The consistency layer catches this where the ML model fails. |

---

### TC-C02 — Plausible Prediction Preserved ✅
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea after eating"` |
| **Predictions** | `Food Poisoning`, `Gastroenteritis`, `GERD` |
| **Consistency Score** | `HIGH` for all three (GI overlap confirmed) |
| **Penalty Applied** | `1.0` (no penalty) |
| **Key Point to Explain** | When the ML output matches the symptom profile, the consistency layer passes predictions through untouched. |

---

### TC-C03 — Partial Overlap with Mixed Symptoms
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a sore throat, runny nose, and joint pain"` |
| **Predictions** | `Flu (0.75)`, `Common Cold (0.65)`, `Arthritis (0.40)` |
| **After Consistency Check** | `Flu` and `Common Cold` preserved (systemic + respiratory overlap). `Arthritis` downranked (musculoskeletal only — no respiratory overlap with input). |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Shows fine-grained reranking, not just binary suppression. The model adjusts confidences based on multi-category symptom analysis. |

---

## 💬 Feature 4 — Conversational Memory & Follow-up Engine

> **What to demonstrate:** When the model is uncertain, it asks **targeted, disease-specific follow-up questions** drawn from a medical question bank. It also remembers symptoms across turns.

### TC-F01 — Follow-up Triggered by Low Confidence
| | |
|---|---|
| **Turn 1 Input** | `"I have been feeling unwell lately"` |
| **System Response** | Follow-up questions triggered (high entropy). E.g., *"Are you experiencing body aches?"*, *"Do you have a fever?"*, *"Do you have a sore throat?"* |
| **Turn 2 Input** | `"Yes, I have body aches and a high fever"` |
| **System Response** | Prediction refined with combined context. Likely `Flu` gains confidence. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The `SymptomMemory` accumulates symptom context across turns. The `FollowupEngine` uses the `question_bank.json` to generate disease-relevant questions. |

---

### TC-F02 — Follow-up for Asthma Differentiation
| | |
|---|---|
| **Turn 1 Input** | `"I'm having trouble breathing and my chest feels tight"` |
| **System Response** | Questions: *"Do you experience shortness of breath?"*, *"Is there any wheezing when you breathe?"*, *"Do you feel chest tightness?"* |
| **Turn 2 Input** | `"Yes, there's a wheezing sound and it gets worse at night"` |
| **System Response** | `Asthma` confidence increases. GERD and anxiety downranked. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The follow-up questions are **disease-targeted**, not generic. They come from the curated `question_bank.json` linked to the top predictions. |

---

### TC-F03 — Follow-up Skipped (High Confidence)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a fever of 102F, body aches all over, sore throat, runny nose, and I feel exhausted"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | No follow-up questions. Final prediction returned directly. |
| **Top Prediction** | `Flu` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | When **entropy is low and the Top-2 gap is large**, follow-up is skipped. The model is confident enough to respond. |

---

### TC-F04 — Multi-Turn Memory Accumulation
| | |
|---|---|
| **Turn 1** | `"I've had a headache for two days"` |
| **Turn 2** | `"I also notice I'm very sensitive to light"` |
| **Turn 3** | `"And I feel nauseous when the headache peaks"` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | System accumulates all three inputs. Prediction by Turn 3 should favour `Migraine`. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Unlike a stateless single-turn system, MediAssist's `SymptomMemory` builds a richer picture over a conversation session. |

---

## 🏠 Feature 5 — Home Care Recommendations & Severity Gating

> **What to demonstrate:** Home care remedies are **only provided for non-critical conditions**. For critical diseases, the system immediately escalates to "seek emergency care" with no home remedy suggestions.

### TC-H01 — Home Care for Non-Critical Condition ✅
| | |
|---|---|
| **Disease Predicted** | `Common Cold` |
| **Expected Home Care** | "Rest adequately", "Stay hydrated", "Use saline nasal spray", "Warm fluids like soup or tea" |
| **Severity** | `low` |
| **Emergency Escalation** | None |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The `HomeCareRecommender` safely provides wellness advice for minor conditions. |

---

### TC-H02 — Home Care Blocked for Critical Disease 🚫
| | |
|---|---|
| **Disease Predicted** | `Pneumonia` |
| **Expected Home Care** | ❌ Empty — NO home remedies provided |
| **Expected Message** | `"Immediately seek emergency medical care"` |
| **Severity** | `critical` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The `is_critical()` method detects critical disease keywords (`pneumonia`, `stroke`, `tuberculosis`, etc.) and **removes the home_care list entirely** to prevent false safety. |

---

### TC-H03 — Dengue Severe — No Remedies Shown 🚫
| | |
|---|---|
| **Disease Predicted** | `Severe Dengue` |
| **Expected Behaviour** | `home_care: []` — escalation message only. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | "Severe dengue" is in the critical keywords list. Home remedies (like drinking papaya juice — a common folk remedy) are explicitly blocked. |

---

### TC-H04 — Fallback for Unknown Disease ⚠️
| | |
|---|---|
| **Disease Predicted** | `Rare Syndrome X` (not in database) |
| **Expected Home Care** | Generic fallback: *"Stay hydrated"*, *"Get adequate rest"*, *"Monitor symptoms carefully"* |
| **Seek Medical Attention If** | *"Symptoms worsen significantly"*, *"Fever exceeds 102°F"*, *"Breathing difficulty develops"* |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The system gracefully degrades to a safe, generic fallback — never returns an empty or broken response. |

---

## 📝 Feature 6 — Audit Logging & Explainability

> **What to demonstrate:** Every safety decision is recorded in **structured JSON logs** in `logs/safety/` for full clinical auditability.

### TC-L01 — Emergency Override Log
| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger Input** | `"I have crushing chest pain and irregular heartbeat"` |
| **Log File** | `logs/safety/emergency_overrides.log` |
| **Log Contains** | `timestamp`, `input`, `detected_categories: ["Cardiac Emergency"]`, `triggered_symptoms`, `escalation message` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Every emergency override is **timestamped and logged** — important for healthcare audits and research. |

---

### TC-L02 — Consistency Penalty Log
| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger Input** | Any input where a prediction is suppressed (e.g., eye disease for fever + cough) |
| **Log File** | `logs/safety/medical_consistency.log` |
| **Log Contains** | `detected_symptoms`, `reranking_changes`, `suppressed_predictions`, `penalties_applied` |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The system provides a complete **audit trail of why a prediction was downranked** — not just a black box. This is critical for clinical explainability. |

---

## 📊 Feature 7 — Unsafe Prediction Rate (Safety Metrics)

> **What to demonstrate:** MediAssist evaluates itself against healthcare-specific safety metrics that go beyond standard ML accuracy.

### TC-M01 — Emergency Escalation Accuracy (EEA) ✅
| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Emergency Escalation Accuracy (EEA) | > 95% | **100%** (on 5-case suite) |
| Missed Emergency Rate (MER) | ~0% | **0%** |

**Test Cases Used:**
```
"coughing up blood"        → True Emergency  → Correctly Escalated ✅
"mild headache"            → Not Emergency   → Correctly Passed ✅
"slurred speech"           → True Emergency  → Correctly Escalated ✅
"bleeding gums"            → True Emergency  → Correctly Escalated ✅
"runny nose"               → Not Emergency   → Correctly Passed ✅
```

---

### TC-M02 — Consistency Suppression Verification
| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I have a high fever and cough"` |
| **Original Predictions** | `Common Cold (0.80)`, `Impetigo (0.70)` |
| **After Penalty** | `Common Cold (0.80)`, `Impetigo (0.07)` |
| **Assertion** | `impetigo_probability <= 0.07` ✅ |
| **Key Point to Explain** | The 90% penalty (×0.1 multiplier) is quantifiably verifiable in the test suite. |

| **Key Point to Explain** | The engine accumulates all matching categories — it doesn't stop at the first match. |

---

### TC-X06 — Critical Disease via Home Care Check
| | |
|---|---|
| **Simulated Disease** | `"Heart Failure"` |
| **`is_critical()` Return** | `True` (keyword match: `heart failure`) |
| **Home Care Output** | `home_care: []`, `severity: critical`, seek emergency care message. |
| **Key Point to Explain** | Even if the emergency rule engine is bypassed (e.g., symptom was ambiguous), the home care layer adds a second line of defence. |
